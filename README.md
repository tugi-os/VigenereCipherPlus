# VigenereCipherPlus
VigenèreCipherPlus: This project is my first step into cryptography, enhancing the classic Vigenère Cipher with random vowel shifts for added complexity. Developed as a learning exercise, it features unique encryption methods and shows my journey with some AI-assisted code improvements.
